# please god no go away you smell funny

To call me a programmer is to tell a big, fat lie

To call me a monkey is truth, as monkey see, monkey do

I'm using GitHub primarily to store Payday 2 mods I've made in the event of a hard drive failure and also make it easy to roll back to an older version if I make a big oopsie and can't fix it for some reason, since I'm not that good at programming anything

If something I make breaks due to a game update, I'll probably only be able to fix it if it's really simple to do so
